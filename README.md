# 42_so_long

Hello, this repository contains a fun little project done as part of the 42 cursus that aims to create a 2D game where a character you control navigates a grid based labyrinth to grab all collectibles before escaping the level. This was developed on linux using the 42 minilibX library for graphical projects. Have a nice day.
